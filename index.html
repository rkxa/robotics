    This week I brainstormed ideas for my first robot. Also we were in groups and came up with solutions that can make the school better. Right now we're learning about bioengeniering and how we can make prostetic limbs for animals or even humans. <br>

     In these two weeks we worked on the egg drop project, me and my partners' egg survived. We used cabbage, bubble wrap, duct tape and a plastic bag to make it survive even tho the bag didnt help much. After that we got to eat some bread with jelly and peanut butter. Today some of our materials for the projects arrived and we will be starting on building them soon. A couple of days ago a speaker came to our class to talk about what he did for his project when he was in college, because he had his own design project but on a more professional level.
