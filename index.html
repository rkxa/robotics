    This week I brainstormed ideas for my first robot. Also we were in groups and came up with solutions that can make the school better. Right now we're learning about bioengeniering and how we can make prostetic limbs for animals or even humans. <br>

     In these two weeks we worked on the egg drop project, me and my partners' egg survived. We used cabbage, bubble wrap, duct tape and a plastic bag to make it survive even tho the bag didnt help much. After that we got to eat some bread with jelly and peanut butter. Today some of our materials for the projects arrived and we will be starting on building them soon. A couple of days ago a speaker came to our class to talk about what he did for his project when he was in college, because he had his own design project but on a more professional level.

         Last week we all got our products for our projects and started working on them. Ive been more focused on programming my Arduino board since most of the functions made by the robot will have to be programmed. I havent started programming the actual board just yet but Im practicing to see remotely close how it should be done.

        This week we kept prograssing in our work. I started wiring the robot and welded them together so im almost there all i need to do is to program the actual mother board.

            This week we just worked more on our projects, I wired everything and made them longer, made sure the mother board fits the box and made a hole in the box for the wire to connect and turn on the robot. We also made paper boats and tested out on how long they can float with weights on them.

            We continued working on our projects and Im starting on the wiring. Also we worked in pairs to make a base for the water balloon to stay at the end of the ruler and it was fun.My group came up with a great design. We didnt end up winnning because we held the ruler the wrong way and the balloon slipped through the bottom.

            This week we kept working on our projects like usual but for this Thursday challenge we split into teams and had to walk around school counting wheels and doors to see who wins. We didnt get to work on our projects as much because there are AP testings going on.

           This week we just stayed in class most of the time. I finished wiring my robot and started programming him. We had questions to answer as a challenge and got one of them right. We also made a box that can catch water bloons which was fun.

                I have gone further with my coding this week but besides that we didnt really do much besides the thursday challenge. For the thursday challenge we had to build a box or a part of it out of tubes and the connecting piece while being blindfolded and guided by our partner. My partner and I won.

                Im almost done with programming my board and i learned how to program lights. For this weeks thurday challenge we got put into groups of 3 and got told what our final is going to be. We are going to build big boats and race across the school pool which is a really cool final exam.

                    In these last two weeks we worked on our boats mainly, we spent more time on them than intended but we got it done. I drew on the boat and made it look more presentable. Sadly we wont be able to finish our projects and i hoped to see it actually work and draw patterns by itself but we dont have enough time for me to finish putting it together. This semester i learned a lot. How to program my own website, how to program my own motherboard and build my own robot.
