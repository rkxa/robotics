    This week I brainstormed ideas for my first robot. Also we were in groups and came up with solutions that can make the school better. Right now we're learning about bioengeniering and how we can make prostetic limbs for animals or even humans. <br>

     In these two weeks we worked on the egg drop project, me and my partners' egg survived. We used cabbage, bubble wrap, duct tape and a plastic bag to make it survive even tho the bag didnt help much. After that we got to eat some bread with jelly and peanut butter. Today some of our materials for the projects arrived and we will be starting on building them soon. A couple of days ago a speaker came to our class to talk about what he did for his project when he was in college, because he had his own design project but on a more professional level.

         Last week we all got our products for our projects and started working on them. Ive been more focused on programming my Arduino board since most of the functions made by the robot will have to be programmed. I havent started programming the actual board just yet but Im practicing to see remotely close how it should be done.

        This week we kept prograssing in our work. I started wiring the robot and welded them together so im almost there all i need to do is to program the actual mother board.

            This week we just worked more on our projects, I wired everything and made them longer, made sure the mother board fits the box and made a hole in the box for the wire to connect and turn on the robot. We also made paper boats and tested out on how long they can float with weights on them.
